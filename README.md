# Metro-Autotyper

Metro Autotyper is a simple Python GUI program that allows the user to automate typing tasks in a variety of ways. I decided to create this program as I felt most other autotypers were either lacking in features, or weren't behaving the way I needed them to.

# Features
- Message looping/repeating mode
- Human-typing mode
- Multi-typer
- Configurable hotkeys

# Installation
Be sure to have the following dependencies:
Python 3
pyautogui
keyboard

Arch Linux:
yay -S python-pyautogui python-keyboard

Windows 10:
pip install pyautogui keyboard

# Usage
python metro-autotyper.sy
(Sudo permissions required for hotkeys to work)

Tested on: Arch Linux (Wayland), Windows 10.
